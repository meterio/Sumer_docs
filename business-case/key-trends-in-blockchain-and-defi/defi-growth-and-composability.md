# DeFi growth and Composability

Though the introduction of new blockchain networks and decentralized applications are a critical part of the broader adoption of DeFi and WEB3, they have collectively crippled the DeFi composability due to inefficiencies introduced in the primitive at the core of WEB3 adoption – _**Assets/ Tokens**_

The key adoption challenges introduced by these stakeholders are;

> ### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Wrapped Assets across blockchains break composability</mark>

Introduction of wrapped assets that are non-fungible with the assets on the native chain

* <mark style="color:yellow;">ETH on Ethereum ≠ ETH on Binance Smart Chain ≠ ETH on Avalanche</mark>&#x20;

> ### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Wrapped Assets by Interoperability Solutions/ Bridges break composability</mark>

Deployment of wrapped assets by different bridging solutions that are non-fungible on the same chain. Each decentralized application has chosen to deploy assets provided by different bridging solutions

* <mark style="color:yellow;">BTC on Ethereum by WBTC ≠ BTC on Ethereum by Binance ≠ BTC on Ethereum by Ren</mark>

Deployment of wrapped assets by same bridging solutions that are non-fungible with the same native asset on another chain

* <mark style="color:yellow;">ETH on BSC by Multichain ≠ ETH on Moonriver by Multichain ≠ ETH on Avalanche by Multichain</mark>

> ### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Choice of wrapped assets by dApps breaks composability</mark>

Support of wrapped assets that are non-fungible on the same blockchain (2. a.)

<mark style="color:yellow;">Instead of focusing on transmitting information securely, each solution (blockchain/Bridge/dApp) has chosen to create its own liquidity solution on the application layer causing “liquidity walls''</mark>. In addition to liquidity walls, this approach has also fractured the direct communication channel between smart contracts.&#x20;

Imagine connecting to the Internet through “proxy servers”, the functionality of cross-chain smart contracts is greatly limited by these “proxy servers”.
