# Borrowing Market

### Why would I borrow instead of selling my assets?&#x20;

Selling your assets means closing your position on that particular asset. Hence, if you are long on the asset, you would not be entitled to the potential upside value gain. By borrowing you are able to obtain liquidity (working capital) without selling your assets.

### What are homogeneous and Heterogeneous groups that determine the borrowing limit for assets?&#x20;

Homogeneous Group – Assets that represent the same underlying risk profile, liquidity, and value&#x20;

* USD - USDC, USDT, BUSD
* ETH - ETH, BETH (BSC), WETH&#x20;
* BTC - WBTC, RenBTC&#x20;

Heterogeneous Group – Assets that do not represent the same underlying value&#x20;

* USDC ≠ ETH ≠ BTC
