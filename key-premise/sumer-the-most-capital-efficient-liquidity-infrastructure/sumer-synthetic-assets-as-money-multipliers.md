# Sumer Synthetic Assets as Money Multipliers

Sumer was inspired by a traditional finance solution: deposit in your local bank and get a travelers’ check or credit card going globally. Users can now create synthetic suUSD, suETH and suBTC with the same lending deposit, enabling a travelers' check-like experience for omni-chain DeFi and participation in new ecosystems while retaining yields (staking, restaking, lending) on their native chain.

\
Sumer Synthetic Assets use Sumer’s Capital Efficient unified liquidity pool to mint the SuTokens at up to 98.5% LTV for correlated assets and at no cost. Defi users can further bridge SuTokens across any supported networks through our reputed partners Chainlink CCIP and LayerZero. &#x20;
