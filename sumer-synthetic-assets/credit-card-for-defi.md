# Credit Card for DeFI

### Imagine a credit card for DeFi

* Assets travel wherever you go!&#x20;

When you travel across a blockchain, your assets travel with you just like your funds travel with your credit card — they are liquid, they are spendable, and are easy to convert back to your native chain.&#x20;

* Assets travel wherever you want – for you!&#x20;

When you purchase a product (NFT) or a service (lending and borrowing) on a non-native blockchain, your assets travel for you to complete the experience just like you make an international purchase with your credit card – the DAPPs seamlessly support the cross-chain experience.&#x20;
