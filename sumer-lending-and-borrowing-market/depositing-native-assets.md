# Depositing Native Assets

1. DeFI users looking to leverage the new multi-chain fungible asset class can deposit the whitelisted assets to the protocol across all supported networks.&#x20;
2. The protocol aggregates the deposit from each user into a pool of assets controlled by smart contracts, making it a fungible resource for the protocol while allowing users to withdraw their deposit at any time.&#x20;
3. In return for the supplied assets, liquidity providers will receive corresponding cToken (e.g., cETH, cUSDC), which entitles them to redeem the supplied assets in the future.&#x20;
4. The value of cToken will continuously increase reflecting the deposit interest rates, which is set as a function of the supply & demand of the assets.&#x20;
5. The user can choose whether he wants to use the supplied asset as collateral or not&#x20;
