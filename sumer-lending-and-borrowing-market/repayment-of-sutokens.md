# Repayment of SuTokens

1. Users can repay the minted SuTokens to the Sumer Protocol up to the minted balance. By default, if multiple assets are supplied to mint SuTokens, the collateral available for withdrawal will be the asset with lower Loan to Value.&#x20;
2. If partial repayment is made, the minted balance may be non-zero.&#x20;
3. There is no interest on minted SuTokens. The protocol has the option to charge users an interest on minting while repaying the minted SuTokens. However, the minting interest is set as 0% at the launch of the protocol. Any changes to the mint interest will be made through the governance process.&#x20;
4. Repayment of SuTokens is the burning of synthetic assets from circulation&#x20;
5. The protocol has the option to charge users an exit fee while repaying the minted SuTokens. **However, the exit fee is set as 0% at the launch of the protocol.** Any changes to the exit fee will be made through the governance process.
