# Repay SuToken Liability

Users can repay the minted SuTokens to the Sumer Protocol up to the minted balance.&#x20;

By default, if multiple assets are supplied as collateral to mint SuTokens, the collateral available for withdrawal will be the asset with lower Loan to Value.&#x20;

### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Partial Repayment</mark>

Users can make partial repayment of their SuToken liability. On partial repayment, the SuToken liability will be non-zero and not all collateral is available for withdrawal.&#x20;

However, there is no interest accrual as minting SuTokens has no interest cost.
