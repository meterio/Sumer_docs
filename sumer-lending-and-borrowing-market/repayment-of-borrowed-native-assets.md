# Repayment of Borrowed Native Assets

1. Borrowers can repay assets to the Sumer Protocol up to the borrowed balance. By default, if multiple assets are supplied to borrow assets, the collateral available for withdrawal will be the asset with lower Loan to Value&#x20;
2. If partial repayment is made, the borrow balance may be non-zero, and continue to accrue interest. Repayment is a transfer of tokens from the borrower back to the token market.
