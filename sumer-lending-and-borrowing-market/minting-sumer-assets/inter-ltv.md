# Inter LTV

The Inter LTV is applicable in three scenarios&#x20;

* This is applicable when minting SuTokens by depositing native assets across heterogeneous groups. The depositing assets (ETH) are provided as collateral to mint SuTokens across a heterogeneous group (SuUSD).&#x20;

By design, the LTV for Inter LTV scenario will be the lowest of LTV available in Intra SuLTV and Intra LTV scenario
