# Intra LTV

The Intra LTV is applicable in two scenarios&#x20;

1. This is applicable when borrowing native assets by depositing native assets within the same homogeneous group. The depositing assets within a homogeneous group (USDC) are provided as collateral to borrow stable coins within the same homogeneous group (USDT).&#x20;
2. It is also applicable when borrowing native assets by depositing SuTokens within the same homogeneous group. The deposit of SuTokens assets within a homogeneous group (SuUSD) is provided as collateral to borrow stable coins within the same homogeneous group (BUSD).&#x20;

By design, the LTV for Intra LTV scenario will be lower than the LTV available in Intra SuLTV scenario
