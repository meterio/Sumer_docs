# Sumer.Money: Cross-chain Synthetic Assets Protocol

Sumer is a cross-chain synthetic assets protocol with a lending and borrowing market, deployed simultaneously on a network of supported chains.

Sumer enables creation of SuTokens (Synthetic Assets of USD, ETH and BTC) to provide a credit card-like experience to users. SuTokens break cross-chain liquidity & smart contract communication barriers while enabling non-custodial, highly decentralized & secure cross- chain transfers.
