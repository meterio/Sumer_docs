# Sumer.Money: The Most Capital Efficient Blockchain Liquidity Infrastructure

Sumer is a blockchain liquidity infrastructure with capital efficiency and security as its top priorities.  The key highlights featuring in the Sumer's protocol design are;

1. Efficient and innovative DeFi engine. &#x20;

Sumer supports correlated (ETH, LSTs, LRTS) and uncorrelated (ETH, USDC) asset positions within a unified liquidity pool maximizing capital efficiency for lending and looping. The novel risk engine automatically adjusts LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratios based on users' liabilities and collaterals, optimizing capital efficiency without adding risks.

2. Synthetic assets create money multiplier

Create synthetic suUSD, suETH and suBTC with the same lending deposit, enabling a travelers' check like experience for omni-chain DeFi and participation in new ecosystems while retaining native yields.  Your assets do not have to leave their native chains while you earn yield with SuTokens across chains.

3. Future high performance L1 on synthetic assets

Sumerâ€™s unique Supernova core is a high performance EVM engine providing web2 level of experience in a highly decentralized network.  The core will be contributed to the Cosmos SDK as a CometBFT alternative. This L1 provides additional utility and yield for synthetic assets, with the Sumer token serving as the PoS token for the blockchain.&#x20;
