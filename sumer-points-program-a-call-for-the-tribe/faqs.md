## What are the important things to keep in mind? <a href="#f2aa" id="f2aa"></a>

* Sumer maintains the rights to stop, pause, and resume the program at any time
* Referring fake accounts is prohibited and anti-Sybil measures will be incorporated
* If users withdraw during the day before the snapshot, they forgo points for the day
* Only values above $1 will be accounted to determine points
* Daily points will be calculated at randomly through the day to prevent mercenary points farming
* **Points are awarded for balances at the time of the snapshot**
* The exact bifurcation of the allocation between Points Based Pool and NFT Based Pool is in the works though it will be highly skewed towards Points Based Pool to reward users appropriately for their risk.
