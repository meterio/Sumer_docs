# Points Based Program

## How does it work? <a href="#ed63" id="ed63"></a>

Users can earn Sumer points by doing any of the following things:

1. Deposit
2. Provide Synthetic Asset liquidity on Partner DEX
3. Refer

Points can be earned daily from either of these actions; however, some actions will earn more points than others.

### Deposit points <a href="#id-18c6" id="id-18c6"></a>

Depositing supported assets in Sumer will give users 1 to 4 points per 10 dollars daily based on asset type and promotions. For example major assets like ETH, USDC, USDT and DAI have 4x multipliers at launch.

The exact points earned are influenced by Multipliers — to incentivize specific assets and Utilization Rate.

* _**Multipliers**_

Special events (launch week, New Partner asset listing) will have bonus points through multipliers clearly communicated through Sumer App and Socials.

* _**Utilization Rate**_

The points earned are net of utilization of the deposit pool. A 1x multiplier pool with 10% utilization will give 0.9 Points per 10 USD TVL daily.

**Note:** Users need to have liquidity on the protocol daily at the time of snapshot to earn points. Snapshot is taken at random time during the day to avoid mercenary points farming.

### Referral points <a href="#bf6d" id="bf6d"></a>

To broaden the protocol footprint; similar to most protocols, Sumer also has introduced a referral system to encourage users to invite their friends into Sumer Program. The rewards are as follows:

* The referrer earns 10% of the points earned by the referee.
* If the referee becomes a referrer, the original referrer earns 1% of the points earned by the new referee
* Users who use a referral code also benefit more from receiving an additional 5% lifetime bonus

**Note:** Users can generate an invite code on [https://points.sumer.money/](https://points.sumer.money/). After the launch promotion period, you may have to earn some initial points in order to generate invite code.

### Liquidity Provisioning points <a href="#id-82c0" id="id-82c0"></a>

Providing Synthetic Asset Liquidity on Partner DEX will 1 to 4 points per 10 dollars daily based on asset type and promotions. The eligible pairs will be available on the Sumer Points Program Points dashboard.

The points accumulated by the user are influenced by Multipliers — to incentivize specific assets.

#### _**Multipliers**_

Special events (launch week, New Partner asset listing) will have bonus points through multipliers clearly communicated through Sumer App and Socials.

**Note**: Users need to have liquidity on the protocol daily at the time of snapshot to earn points. Snapshot is taken at random time during the day to avoid mercenary points farming.

### Points Penalty: Non-productive usage <a href="#id-3bb7" id="id-3bb7"></a>

The ideal path to maximize points on the points program is;

1. Deposit high multiplier Assets (Stablecoin, ETH, and BTC)
2. Deposit assets with partner rewards (like LRTs and Pendle PT on Arbitrum)
3. Mint Sumer Synthetic Assets (suUSD, suETH, suBTC)and provide liquidity on Partner DEX (for e.g. suUSD-USDC pool on Aerodrome)

Excessively sold Sumer Synthetic Assets will offset the points earned from the TVL. Penalty points will depend on the portion of Sumer Synthetic assets not held in the wallets or in liquidity on DEXes by the users.

**Note:** Please make sure you link all your related wallets to the same Sumer points account.
