We are pleased to announce that the Sumer Points Program went live on 18 July 2024 encompassing Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base and Meter Networks. We are proud to support our asset partners in [ether.fi](https://medium.com/u/7dd09e419971?source=post\_page-----5197542dc624--------------------------------), [Pendle Team](https://medium.com/u/61f61c50fafb?source=post\_page-----5197542dc624--------------------------------), [Kelp DAO](https://medium.com/u/54a09cc33984?source=post\_page-----5197542dc624--------------------------------), [Puffer Finance](https://medium.com/u/1c9fcaddb49b?source=post\_page-----5197542dc624--------------------------------) and [Angle](https://medium.com/u/1a9ed11225f6?source=post\_page-----5197542dc624--------------------------------).

We are also excited to announce that Sumer will allocate between _**5–15% of the Total Supply**_ to our early supporters for their contribution to the TVL on Sumer and interaction with the protocol.

Sumer Points Program broadly encompasses,

> **A Points Based Airdrop Pool:** Rewarding users for the risk they take through the Points Program — Higher TVL contribution, higher rewards
>
> **A NFT Based Airdrop Pool:** Ensuring fair and equitable distribution of Rewards through Sumerian Gods NFT Program — Higher protocol interaction, higher rewards

While high capital users can earn more rewards for their TVL contribution and risks, the protocol also is making an effort to ensure fair and equitable distribution to our user base through distribution based on amount and rarity of NFT collected.
