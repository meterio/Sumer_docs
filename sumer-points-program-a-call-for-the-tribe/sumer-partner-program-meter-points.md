# Sumer Partner Program â€” Meter Points

In addition to Sumer Points, users can earn Meter Points from our Partner Meter.io for providing Liquidity on any of the eligible DeFI applications on the Meter Network (including Sumer).

Users will get 1 Meter point per 10 dollars in TVL daily.

Meter Points currently supports Voltswap Finance, Sumer, Meridian Finance and Symmetric Finance. Meter Points are eligible for additional airdrops on the Meter Network.

**Note**: Users need to have liquidity on the protocol daily at the time of snapshot to earn points. Snapshot is taken at random time during the day to avoid mercenary points farming.
