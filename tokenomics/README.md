# Tokenomics

**DISCLAIMER** - _The Beta Launch of Sumer Protocol in Q2 2022 will be without a token. The Token Generation Event (TGE) will take place in Q3 2022._

The SUMER token is the Governance Token of Sumer Protocol and oversees the entire ecosystem including future iterations of the protocol.

SUMER is required to vote and decide on the outcome of proposals through SUMER Improvement Proposals (SIPs). The protocol will initially be governed by the founding team, and will eventually transition to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). As part of the DAO, holders of the SUMER token will be able to initiate proposals and vote on issues that will steer the direction of the protocol.

The total supply of SUMER will be 100 Million tokens. The token distribution is designed to ensure that market participants who actively engage with the platform will receive SUMER tokens. The majority of the tokens will be distributed through the Liquidity Mining program.
