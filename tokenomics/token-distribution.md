# Token Distribution

The aim of the token distribution is to ensure healthy engagement of the protocol.&#x20;

A healthy protocol would be one where there is a consistently high utilization rate of the SuTokens balanced by an increasing lending pool.&#x20;

SUMER holders can propose improvements and collectively decide on the optimum solution for the protocol. SUMER tokens will be distributed in a targeted manner via Liquidity and Community Incentives to achieve a balance of high market utilization and wide distribution of governance participants. This is subject to changes via governance as the protocol evolves and market conditions change.
